================

The following packages may be useful as an alternative to or used in
conjunction with PyXB:

- The `Zolera SOAP Infrastructure
  <http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/zsi.html>`_ is the backbone of the
  `Python Web Services <http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/>`_ project.  It is
  specifically intended to support web service interaction with SOAP and
  WSDL.  The primary purpose of ZSI is SOAP, but it generates bindings for
  some XML Schema constructs.  The last release of ZSI appears to have been
  in 2007, so much of this paragraph could be reworded to be in the past
  tense.

- `generateDS <http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/generateDS.html>`_ is an
  alternative package that is intended to do the same general thing as PyXB,
  though it uses a very different approach for extending bindings.
  generateDS is still under active development/maintenance.

- The `Amara XML Toolkit <http://xml3k.org/Amara>`_ appears to be a fairly
  complete set of XML tools for Python evolved from the `4Suite
  <http://4suite.org/>`_ infrastructure.  Amara supports `binding an object
  to an existing XML document
  <http://xml3k.org/Amara2/Whatsnew#Creatingabinderydocumentfromscratch>`_
  and has references to `RELAX NG <http://relaxng.org/>`_ and `Schematron
  <http://www.schematron.com/>`_, but does not address `XML Schema
  <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema>`_.
