About the Demonstration Web Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There seem to be very few free public web services that are maintained and
provide an interesting capability that does not require significant effort
to demonstrate in an satisfactory way.

The :ref:`examples` in the PyXB documentation refer to web services found
through `Google <http://www.google.com/>`_ and other search engines.  Some of
these services are free; for others the API schemas could be obtained by
anonymous download but use of the service would require a paid subscription.

These web services are used for demonstration purposes only.  If you
represent a company providing one of these services and object to its use in
this way, email the developer to have the service references removed.  If
you provide interesting web services and would like to contribute to open
source development and the promotion of web services by explicitly
permitting this use, email the developer.
