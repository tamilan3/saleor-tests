Architecture
************

The architecture of PyXB requires an understanding of four models.
:ref:`namespaces` describe how objects are aggregated by name and kind.  The
:ref:`componentModel` represents XML schema using the thirteen component
types defined in the `XML schema specification
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/>`_.  The :ref:`bindingModel` describes
how Python classes provide a Pythonic representation of the information
within specific components.  Finally, the :ref:`contentModel` describes how
the component model of a specific schema supports translation between XML
documents and Python bindings.
