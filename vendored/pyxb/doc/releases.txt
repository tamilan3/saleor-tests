***************
Release History
***************

Historically, the release number of PyXB indicated stability in a way similar
to that of Linux several years ago, with even/odd of the middle digit
indicating stability/development.  That policy ended as of 1.1.3, and the
relaxed policy is:

- All releases consist of three non-negative integers

- A release *series* refers to all releases with the same first two integers.
  The third integer indicates an incremental update to the system.

- Should it be necessary to make wholesale changes that affect either
  stability or interface, the second or even first integer will be
  incremented

- Critical bug fixes may result in new releases in older series, but this is
  expected to be extremely unusual.  Such fixes will be made on a branch of
  the :ref:`git repository <git_repository>`.

- All packaged releases are intended to be of comparable stability, with bug
  fixes and most enhancements causing an increment in the third integer

As examples, :ticket:`correcting the content model for weak determinism <112>`
resulted in PyXB 1.2.0, and :ticket:`support of Python 3 <150>` was completed
in PyXB 1.2.4.  :ticket:`support for XML Schema 1.1 <217>` will not be addressed
until PyXB 1.3.0 if at all.


1.2.x
=====

The 1.2.x release series introduces a new content model which provides much
more help in resolving validation errors.  Concurrent with this support was
dropped for Python 2.4 and 2.5.  The 1.2.x release works with Python 2.6 and
2.7 and as of PyXB 1.2.4 also with Python 3.1 and later.  Some unit tests are
skipped under Python 2.6 due to insufficient support for validating exception
attributes.

.. _pyxb-1.2.5:

1.2.5 (18 Sep 2016)
-------------------

This is a roll-up aggregating all fixes since the last major release nearly
two years ago.

The following reported `defects/enhancements
<https://github.net/pabigot/pyxb/issues/>`_ have been addressed:

- Deconflict class properties from module identifiers.  :issue:`27`
- Correct handling of `xsi:type <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#xsi_type>`_
  on non-abstract types.  :issue:`32`
- Fix generation of zero-span durations.  :issue:`38`
- Document how to use file URIs on Windows.  :issue:`34`
- Document need for common bindings when generating OpenGIS bindings.
  :issue:`28`
- Fix literal representation of not-a-number and infinite values. :issue:`43`
- Document that Python 3 is supported.  :issue:`36`
- Fix processing of empty binary data tpyes.  :issue:`51`
- Fix transition sort key to support Python 3.  :issue:`52`
- Fix generation of modules that cannot be imported due to use of invalid
  characters in the module path.  :issue:`48`
- Add a method to xsd.base64Binary to allow a heavy-weight validation step to
  be bypassed.  :issue:`50`

.. _pyxb-1.2.4:

1.2.4 (19 Oct 2014)
-------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.2.4

The major feature of this release is a new approach to Python 3 support based
on the `six <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/>`_ module.  This resolves
:ticket:`support for Python 3 <150>` and allows one release of PyXB to support
Python versions from 2.6 through 3.4, excluding 3.0.  The ``maintainer/2to3``
script used in PyXB 1.2.3 is no longer supported.  Both the core
implementation and the bindings are compatible with Python 2 and 3.

A second important feature was correct handling of QName by changing the
binding representation from a string to an expanded name that saves the
namespace URI rather than the prefix from the original document.

Finally, with this release primary development and support moves from
SourceForge to `Github <https://github.com/pabigot/pyxb>`_.  Inter-release
updates will be made first on github (on the `next
<https://github.com/pabigot/pyxb/tree/next>`_ branch), and pushed to the
SourceForge git repository aperiodically.

Other miscellanous changes:

- Correct rich comparisons for _PluralBinding instances.  :ticket:`218`
- Prevent adding non-element content as wildcard elements.  :ticket:`219`
- Provide public API to _CF_enumeration helper methods. :ticket:`221`
- Specify requirements for an acceptable DOM implementation. :ticket:`224`
- Rebase xs:decimal on Python decimal.Decimal to provide high precision
  support. :ticket:`91`
- Support Python 3. :ticket:`150`
- Fix mis-ordered attribute groups use/resolution issue.  :ticket:`230`
- Generate facet values that are valid Python expressions.  :ticket:`231`
- Improve validation failure location for simple values. :ticket:`232`
- Disallow name attribute in internal complex types.  :issue:`6`
- Avoid unbounded non-deterministic expansion.  :issue:`5`
- Reduce namespace intrusion with enumeration types.  :issue:`9`
- Add API to replace simple content complex type values. :issue:`7`
- Fix representation and use of QNames.  :issue:`13`
- Fix generation of wildcard attributes. :issue:`14`
- Fix validation of wildcard types in DOM instances.  :issue:`15`
- Reference github for bug reports.  :issue:`16`:
- Eliminate a gratuitous log warning on a validation failure.  :issue:`17`
- Eliminate improper assertion on extension binding use of imported bindings.
  :issue:`18`
- Support serialization of anonymous namespaces to allow Python copy.deepcopy
  module to work on binding instances.  :issue:`19`
- Generate bindings that are compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.
  :issue:`22`

.. _pyxb-1.2.3:

1.2.3 (18 Sep 2013)
-------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.2.3

This is primarily a bug-fix and clean-up release.  One new feature is that
starting with this release a Python 3 compatible version of PyXB will be
available in the git repository.  For this version, it may be obtained by::

  git clone -b python3/pyxb-1.2.3 git://git.code.sf.net/p/pyxb/code pyxb3-1.2.3

The Python 3 code in this branch is created by automatic conversion of the
Python 2 code using the maintainer/2to3 script.  While not officially
supported until PyXB 1.3.0, Python 3 appears to work correctly with this
version.

Behavioral changes:

- PyXB 1.2.1 automatically filled in the content of fixed elements.  This
  generated invalid documents when the particular element should have been
  absent for some content.  The feature has been removed so fixed elements
  initialize to absent just like every other element.

- The former `--pre-load-archives` option to pyxbgen has been removed and
  replaced by :ref:`pyxbgen--import-augmentable-namespace` which has more
  consistent semantics.  Schema import directives related to a non-augmentable
  namespace (one for which the referenced option has not been provided) will
  be ignored if content for the namespace can be located in any archive or
  builtin.

- Generating DOM (or XML) expressions of bindings that were created by type
  constructors and not associated with elements now cause an exception to be
  raised rather than mis-using the type name as though it were a valid element
  tag.

Code cleanup:

- Trailing whitespace throughout the source has been removed to decrease git
  complaints and non-reproducible patches.
- Several coding practices that would not work under Python3 have been
  replaced with new solutions.

The following reported `defects/enhancements
<http://sourceforge.net/p/pyxb/tickets/>`_ have been addressed:

- Fix DOM style handling of xsi:type attribute.  :ticket:`166`
- Fix problems with nillable simple types.  :ticket:`200`
- Fix problems inserting into plural element attributes.  :ticket:`201`
- Correct namespace-qualified attributes.  :ticket:`202`
- Eliminate automatic derivation of XML element tag from binding type when
  converting an element-free instance to DOM.  :ticket:`203`
- Eliminate default to fixed value for elements.  :ticket:`204`
- Re-word exception when element content was incompatible with fixed value.
  :ticket:`205`
- Fix the aslocal() method for xs:dateTime values with non-UTC timezones.
  :ticket:`206`
- Fix values for restricted duration ranges in pickled data such as namespace
  archives.  :ticket:`207`
- Correct the interpretation of QName-valued base and similar attributes with
  respect to in-scope namespace declarations.  :ticket:`208`
- Rework how to specify that imported namespaces should be processed to extend
  the content model.  :ticket:`209`
- Removed redundant code in pyxbgen relevant to
  :ref:`pyxbgen--wsdl-location`.  :ticket:`210`
- Refine diagnostics when an element with simple type appears in a context
  that expects non-element content.  :ticket:`211`
- Add :api:`pyxb.NonElementContent` to simplify access to non-element content
  in a mixed-content instance.  :ticket:`212`
- Convert assert failures to diagnostic exceptions when generating DOM
  expressions of complex types with simple content where the content is
  missing. :ticket:`213`
- Ensure attribute values are converted from lexical space to value space when
  assigned from an XML representation.  :ticket:`216`

.. _pyxb-1.2.2:

1.2.2 (17 Apr 2013)
-------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.2.2

Almost all changes are bug fixes, including issues with element order when
extending types, name conflicts between XML and Python entities in the
binding, and unicode problems in diagnostics.

PyXB has never intentionally supported using bindings generated by different
versions of PyXB.  This will be enforced from version 1.2.2 onwards.

The following reported `defects/enhancements
<http://sourceforge.net/p/pyxb/tickets/>`_ have been addressed:

- Correct management of changes to default namespace within documents. :ticket:`183`
- Do not interleave base and extension type elements. :ticket:`184`
- Incorrect character range management resulted in regex failure. :ticket:`186`
- Wide unicode mis-defines XML1p0e2 Char class. :ticket:`187`
- Improve contents of StructuralBadDocumentError. :ticket:`189`
- Generate exception details correctly with unicode content. :ticket:`190`
- Namespace must be a reserved symbol within CTD instances.
- PyXB rejects restriction that changes element type. :ticket:`193`
- Multiple cases where names (from imported bindings, namespaces, and
  top-level classes and elements) resulted in conflicts with other top-level
  and class-level names. :ticket:`191`, :ticket:`194`, :ticket:`197`
- Avoid validating content of simple types marked with xsi:nil. :ticket:`195`
- Validate handling of attribute and element form attributes. :ticket:`196`
- Ensure all referenced namespaces are imported into a binding. :ticket:`198`
- Detect import of bindings generated by a different version of PyXB. :ticket:`199`

.. _pyxb-1.2.1:


1.2.1 (17 Dec 2012)
-------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.2.1

.. warning::

   This release has an interface change: the :api:`content
   <pyxb.binding.basis.complexTypeDefinition.content>` method on complex types
   is now deprecated in favor of the :api:`orderedContent
   <pyxb.binding.basis.complexTypeDefinition.orderedContent>` method.  The
   members in the new list have wrapper classes to correctly associate
   instance bindings with the element declaration and to distinguish instances
   with string values from non-element character data.  The old method is
   supported for this release, but will produce a warning when used, and is
   likely to be removed in the next release.

Key features of the release:

- Full support for mixed content schema through a new method
  :api:`orderedContent <pyxb.binding.basis.complexTypeDefinition.orderedContent>` on complex
  binding instances and flags that control when that list affects document
  generation.  See :ref:`mixed_content`.  This is particularly relevant to
  XHTML.

- Immediate validation of values assigned to plural elements.

- A first step to providing finer control of validation, using
  :api:`pyxb.ValidationConfig`

The following reported `defects/enhancements
<http://sourceforge.net/p/pyxb/tickets/>`_ have been addressed:

- Validate :ref:`pyxb.BIND<pyxb_BIND>` at point of use.  :ticket:`69`
- Issues with renamed element (most of which were mis-use of pyxb.BIND).  :ticket:`71`
- Support for default and fixed values in elements. :ticket:`99`
- Support for mixed content.  :ticket:`153`, :ticket:`154`
- Provide an example based on a `help-forum thread
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyxb/forums/forum/956708/topic/5422611/>`_
  to show how to take advantage of PyXB 1.2.x improved diagnostics.
  :ticket:`158`
- Improve interpretation of Python native type values when used in element
  constructors.  :ticket:`175`
- Add :ref:`ECMA-376 (Office Open XML)<bundle_ecma376>` as an optional bundle.
  :ticket:`178`
- Fix invalid error when an all model group had minOccurs=0.  :ticket:`179`
- Add :ref:`Dublin Core<bundle_dc>` to the standard bundles.  :ticket:`180`
- Allow control of element order in generated documents.  :ticket:`181`
- Include wildcard elements in content.  :ticket:`182`

.. _pyxb-1.2.0:

1.2.0 (07 Nov 2012)
-------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.2.0

This is a beta release intended to allow independent verification that the new
content model works.  It is released on SourceForge, but will not be made
available through PyPI until such verification is satisfactory.

Key feature of the release:

- Use of an advanced content model which provides more accurate validation and
  :ref:`much better diagnostics <validating>` when validation fails.

- Elimination of support for Python 2.4 and 2.5 (necessary to ease the path to
  a future Python3 implementation of PyXB).

- Complete rework of the exceptions that normally arise when using binding
  instances.  These exceptions now provide information through attributes
  rather than a text message.

The following reported `defects/enhancements
<http://sourceforge.net/p/pyxb/tickets/>`_ have been addressed:

- Improved diagnostics. :ticket:`26`, :ticket:`75`
- Correct handling of schema where greedy processing fails.  :ticket:`112`,
  :ticket:`133`
- Elements and attributes in generated bindings are emitted in a deterministic
  order sorted by schema and location within schema, to ensure deterministic
  processing and reduce variation between bindings when generation is
  repeated.  :ticket:`164`
- Make documentation annotations from schema available as documentation
  strings for the generated complex type bindings.  :ticket:`79`
- Update OpenGIS bindings to `use W3C XLink schema
  <http://www.ogcnetwork.net/node/1829>`_.  :ticket:`165`

1.1.x
=====

The 1.1.x release series entered maintenance mode with release 1.1.5.  It is
unlikely that further releases will occur, though critical bugs fixes may be
made available in the `release branch
<http://pyxb.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=pyxb/pyxb;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/pyxb-1.1/next>`_.
Bugs reported against 1.1.5 will generally be fixed in the 1.2.x series.

.. _pyxb-1.1.5:

1.1.5 (01 Nov 2012)
-------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.1.5

This is a maintenance release to finalize the 1.1.x series before starting the
1.2.x series.

The following reported `defects/enhancements
<http://sourceforge.net/p/pyxb/tickets/>`_ have been addressed:

- The standard Python logging module is now used.  :ticket:`17`,
  :ticket:`159`, :ticket:`157`
- The potential for changing binding style support has been removed.
  :ticket:`82`
- PyPI/setuptools support has been fixed (again).  :ticket:`130`
- Unit test setup/teardown has been reviewed.  :ticket:`149`
- utf-8 is now used in all PyXB source files.  :ticket:`151`
- Preserve namespace mappings in deep-cloned instances.  :ticket:`155`
- Fix problems revealed by cython and pyflakes.  :ticket:`156`, :ticket:`167`
- User contributions from Jon Foster, with the exception of windows test
  scripts, have been incorporated.  :ticket:`157`
- Correct issues in generator function to retrieve command line.
  :ticket:`161`
- Restore content of ExtraContentError exception.  :ticket:`163`
- Warn rather than abort when apparently redundant schema are included.
  :ticket:`169`


.. _pyxb-1.1.4:

1.1.4 (15 Jun 2012)
-------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.1.4

Key features of the release:

- A large number of bug fixes, especially in the area of internationalization.
  Naive uses of unicode have mostly been eliminated.
- Corrections and improvements to date and time-related types, especially with
  respect to timezones.
- More namespaces have been added in the :ref:`common <bundle_common>`,
  :ref:`WS-* <bundle_wssplat>`, and :ref:`OpenGIS <bundle_opengis>` bundles.
- This release eliminates the separate packages for different bundles; all
  bundles and documentation except for OpenGIS are incorporated into the
  release file.  OpenGIS is present but must be built manually; see
  :ref:`OpenGIS <bundle_opengis>`

Examples have been added:

- ``examples/customization`` shows advanced customization, including injecting
  behavior into binding classes corresponding to types from which other XML
  types are extended or restricted.  It also demonstrates how to introspect
  the bindings within a module, automating much of the process of extending
  multiple bindings with the same functionality.

- ``examples/unicode_jp`` demonstrates internationalization features including
  the ability to intercept PyXB's construction of Python identifiers from XML
  identifiers to produce meaningful identifiers when the schema language is
  not compatible with the Python 2 requirement that identifiers be ASCII.

The following reported `defects/enhancements
<http://sourceforge.net/p/pyxb/tickets/>`_ have been addressed:

- Timezone support for xsd:date types. :ticket:`102`
- Pattern restriction does not work correctly with Unicode. :ticket:`108`
- bad unvalidated generation with simple list. :ticket:`110`
- Make simpleType CF_Enumeration iterable. :ticket:`111`
- toxml fails when wildcard is in unrecognized namespace. :ticket:`114`

- attributes are validated regardless of pyxb.RequireValidWhenParsing. :ticket:`117`
- unable to resolve with absent namespace. :ticket:`119`
- module CreateFromDocument ignores default_namespace. :ticket:`120`
- PyXB elementary data types do not play well with copy/pickling/.... :ticket:`121`
- PxXB should allow to assign None to optional elements and attributes. :ticket:`122`
- unbound wildcard element toxml() fails. :ticket:`123`
- misapplied allow_builtin_generation keyword in Generator. :ticket:`124`
- attributes are not validated regardless of pyxb.RequireValidWhenGenerating. :ticket:`126`
- dateTime objects must be timezone-aware. :ticket:`127`
- most lexical representations for reduced dates wrong. :ticket:`128`
- incorrect timezone adjustment from python values. :ticket:`129`
- validate processing of unicode in assignments and documents. :ticket:`131`
- Crash in PyXB when attempting to retrieve Unicode value from exception. :ticket:`132`
- Name, NMTOKEN, NCName wrong validation regexes. :ticket:`134`
- opengis/scripts/genbind removes all user files. :ticket:`135`
- preserve timezone in processing. :ticket:`136`
- wildcards rejected when validation disabled during parsing. :ticket:`137`
- xsd.dateTime loses microsecond precision. :ticket:`138`
- support alternative XML parsers. :ticket:`139`
- need regular way to replace MakeIdentifier. :ticket:`141`
- Document advanced customization. :ticket:`142`
- cleanup OpenGIS schema bundle. :ticket:`143`
- toxml needs encoding support. :ticket:`144`
- mark encoding in generated output. :ticket:`146`
- domutils references unqualified PyXB exceptions. :ticket:`148`

.. _pyxb-1.1.3:

1.1.3 (09 Sep 2011)
--------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.1.3

General cleanup, finish up a few previously unsupported datatypes.

- Correct extension of a simple type with enumeration restrictions.
  :ticket:`89`

- Use the Python string type as the basis for `xs:hexBinary
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/#hexBinary>`_.
  :ticket:`90`

- Support ``+`` in ``PYXB_ARCHIVE_PATH`` like the documentation says.
  :ticket:`92`

- Correct exception reference.  :ticket:`93`

- Correct handling of the `ur-type
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-1-20010502/#key-urType>`_.  :ticket:`94`

- Automatically provide an `xsi:type <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/#xsi_type>`_
  attribute when the schema uses the ur-type.  :ticket:`95`

- Implement `xs:base64binary
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/#base64Binary>`_.
  :ticket:`83`, :ticket:`96`

- Fix pickling and URI path issues on Windows.  :ticket:`97`, :ticket:`98`

- Do a better job resolving circular dependencies, and don't try to write two
  namespace groups to the same binding file.  :ticket:`104`, :ticket:`105`

- Add a bundle for :ref:`Security Assertion Markup Language <bundle_saml20>`.
  Thanks to Michael van der Westhuizen for providing this (sixteen months
  ago).  :ticket:`106`

- Avoid overwrite of Python `built-in constants
  <http://docs.python.org/library/constants.html>`_, including ``None``,
  ``True``, and ``False``.  :ticket:`107`

.. _pyxb-1.1.2:

1.1.2 (30 May 2010)
-------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.1.2

Complete replacement of the model group portion of the content model.  The
NFA-to-DFA approach is gone.  The resulting system does a better job in less
space and significantly faster: 30% faster on the standard tmsxtvd test,
orders of magnitude on documents with large sequences of optional elements.

Note: A couple unit tests fail due to incidental reasons that will be
addressed when fixing :ticket:`75`.  Also, the architecture documentation for
the validation portion of the content model is completely out of date.

- Handle sequences of optional elements more effectively.  :ticket:`33`

- Correct multi-step attribute restriction/extension.  :ticket:`80`

- Support prefix rewrite for schema location URIs.  :ticket:`81`

- Fix syntax error generating wildcard namespace constraints.  :ticket:`84`

- Support whitespace validation bypass in simple type definitions.  :ticket:`85`

.. _pyxb-1.1.1:

1.1.1 (28 Jan 2010, rev 2135)
-----------------------------

Documentation: http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/PyXB-1.1.1

Major feature is significantly improved ability to determine what content is
not acceptable to the validating parser, and where it can be found in the
document.  See :ref:`invalid-content`.

Also, using keyword parameters in binding instance constructors will now raise
an :api:`pyxb.exceptions_.ExtraContentError` in the case where the keyword does not
correspond to the PyXB-generated identifier associated with an attribute or
element of the class being instantiated.

- Eliminate complaints about reference to deprecated :mod:`sha` module in Python
  2.6.

- Fix assorted problems with mixtures of :ref:`pyxbgen--binding-root`,
  :ref:`pyxbgen--module-prefix`, and :ref:`pyxbgen--write-for-customization`.
  :ticket:`64`, :ticket:`65`

- Eliminate unnecessary attempts to download schema for builtin namespaces.
  :ticket:`63`

- Avoid assertion failure when provided schema location's content looks a
  little, but not enough, like a schema document.  :ticket:`72`

- References to declarations in other namespaces are now calculated locally to
  the module, rather than cached under the expectation the name is valid
  everywhere.  :ticket:`73`

- Imposed consistency on behavior when document root element is not
  recognized.  :ticket:`74`

- Partial implementation of improved error data stored in exceptions.
  :ticket:`75`

- Detect invalid keywords in instance constructor calls.  :ticket:`76`

.. _pyxb-1.1.0:

1.1.0 (30 Nov 2009, rev 2092)
-----------------------------

Mostly nit-picky things, but some changed interface, so we're starting a new
beta series.

- Make handling of invalid xsi:type attributes more robust.  :ticket:`56`

- Use validation flags to control validation (what a novel concept).
  :ticket:`57`

- Fix improper generation of content within elements marked as xsi:nil.
  :ticket:`58`

- Provide mechanism to control default handling of xsi:type attributes in
  instance documents.  :ticket:`60`

- Fix bug where constraining facets were not inherited when deriving simple
  types by restriction.  :ticket:`61`


1.0.x (Stable)
==============

1.0.0 (18 Oct 2009, rev 2068)
-----------------------------

Nobody seems to have found anything critical for a while, and it does what I
want it to, so we'll let this thing run free.

- Replace a reference to a non-existent variable with something that works.
  :ticket:`52`

- Consistently validate instances created from documents no matter which
  parser is used.  :ticket:`53`

- Support caching message references in WSDL SOAP faults.  :ticket:`54`

0.7.x (Beta)
============

0.7.3 (15 Sep 2009, rev 2050)
-----------------------------

A few bug fixes (one major), a couple new features, and separation of the
various components to allow a smaller distribution.

- Fixed a circular reference in the DFA state classes that caused memory bloat
  in long-running processes.  :ticket:`49`

- When PyXB renames an XML element or attribute due to a collision with a
  reserved word, it will write a warning, and at runtime will raise an
  exception if an attempt is made to assign to the original name.
  :ticket:`50`, :ticket:`51`

- Support for pattern restrictions for string-based simple types.
  :ticket:`47`

- Split distribution into multiple files to reduce download size:

   - ``PyXB-base-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Complete release, nothing pre-built
   - ``PyXB-doc-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Overlay with pre-built documentation
   - ``PyXB-common-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Overlay with XHTML bindings
   - ``PyXB-opengis-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Overlay with OpenGIS bindings
   - ``PyXB-wsspat-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Overlay with WS-* bindings
   - ``PyXB-full-@VERSION@.tar.gz`` -- Complete release with all overlays


0.7.2 (25 Aug 2009, rev 1981)
-----------------------------

Primarily to fix a problem with chameleon schemas, but also a couple other
minor issues.

- References to QNames with absent namespaces in chameleon schema included
  into schema with a target namespace could not be resolved.  :ticket:`46`

- Documentation content was not correctly sanitized for use within a Python
  docstring.  :ticket:`45`.

- Elements with complex types with simple content that derived from string
  could not be marked as nil.  :ticket:`48`

0.7.1 (23 Aug 2009, rev 1968)
-----------------------------

None of the enhancements really got in, but lots of minor bug fixes.

- Restored the ability to dump copies of all schemas retrieved from a remote
  location, so you can review them.  :ticket:`28`

- Fixed assorted problems with simple types constructed by list and union.
  :ticket:`35`, :ticket:`40`

- Provide link from content values to the element binding that was used to
  store them.  Useful for quickly identifying the owner element when
  generating a valid child sequence for conversion to DOM.  :ticket:`36`

- Fix validation of attributes with union types.  :ticket:`37`

- Enumeration fixes: Only generate class-level constants for enumerations that
  restrict a string representation (not double, float, etc).  Verify
  enumerations work correctly on list and union constructions.  Duplicate the
  class-level constants for enumerations that are defined in union member
  types.  :ticket:`38`

- Provide a facility to simplify the automatic creation of an instance of the
  appropriate type when storing values into an element.  Makes life with
  anonymous local elements a lot easier.  :ticket:`39`

- Enhance management of namespace prefixes by allowing a system-wide default
  in BindingDOMSupport and by inferring the base name of the module as the
  default prefix for namespaces defined in imported bindings.  :ticket:`41`

- Provided crude facility to bypass validation when generating and parsing
  documents.  :ticket:`44`

- Re-arrange the help for pyxbgen's arguments, and add a script to
  automatically generate the Sphinx tables for it.

- Support bundles of related schemas/namespaces, currently wssplat (for WS-\*)
  and opengis (Geographic Information Systems).

- Got the user-level documentation back up to where it might actually help
  somebody.


0.7.0 (03 Aug 2009, rev 1715)
-----------------------------

This release is identical to 0.5.2 except that the binding interface has
completely changed.  All examples have been updated; the documentation will be
updated later.

Note that the code in PyXB itself has not changed, and is not going to
change.  However, properties produce an interface more natural to most Python
programs, so that has become the default style.  See the --binding-style
parameter to pyxbgen if you want to change this.

- Change the method of accessing elements and attributes in bindings from
  accessor methods (e.g., elt.attr(), elt.setAttr()) to properties (e.g.,
  elt.attr).  :ticket:`18`


0.5.x (Beta)
============

0.5.2 (03 Aug 2009, rev 1706)
-----------------------------

Mostly changes to namespaces in support of profiles and application schemas
which extend other namespaces with special components, or have their own
copies of somebody else's schemas, etc.  See the pyxbgen private/public
namespace switches.

- Presence of nested choice model groups caused the plurality calculations to
  be wrong: some elements were dropped from the model, others were treated as
  lists when only one instance would be permitted.  :ticket:`34`

- Content accessor would return wrong value for elements with simple type of
  list variety.  :ticket:`32`

- Corrected handling of attributes when deriving complex types by
  restriction.  :ticket:`27`

- Added a source module for XML namespace
  (http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace) with bindings linked to the built-in
  component model.  :ticket:`23`

- Fix inadequacies in namespace archive management.  :ticket:`22`

This is expected to be the last release in 0.5.x.  0.7.0 should follow soon
thereafter, and only contain the change of default binding style from accessor
to property.  :ticket:`18`


0.5.1 (16 Jul 2009, rev 1502)
-----------------------------

Fixed various problems with OpenGIS schemas, specifically dependency loops
induced by attempting to keep binding components within modules identified by
the schema they came from, and loss of bindings for one namespace due to its
being overwritten by those for another.

- The presence of a wildcard in a sequence or choice model group caused other
  elements to be lost in the binding.  :ticket:`29`

- Rework content verification to operate on binding instances rather than DOM
  nodes.  :ticket:`24`

- Use `value()` to extract the value of a complex type with simple content;
  the `content()` method works only with element and mixed content.
  :ticket:`21`

- Add support to specify prefix to be used in QNames when generating DOM
  documents from binding instances.  Provide facility to re-use the
  BindingDOMSupport instance for multiple conversions.  :ticket:`15`

- Tightened requirements on content type matching: no more will strings and
  numbers automatically be converted to match the content model (probably for
  a branch you didn't intend).  :ticket:`14`

- Fix problems overwriting binding modules with data from a different set of
  namespaces.  :ticket:`31`.

- Eliminated the schema group modules: too hard to avoid dependency loops.
  Now all components are written into a single module, which is a namespace
  group module if the components cross namespaces.  A namespace-specific
  module still exists, and imports only the relevant components from the group
  module.


0.5.0 (07 Jul 2009, rev 1446)
-----------------------------

Ability to parse many of the OpenGIS schemas (gml, iso19139, citygml, ogc,
ogckml22, om, ows, sensorML, sos, swe, tml, ...).

- Completely rework include and import directives to correctly handle relative
  paths in ``schemaLocation`` attributes and to only import from a given
  location once per namespace. :ticket:`9`, :ticket:`8`, :ticket:`5`

- Parse ``final`` attribute on type definitions (though this has no effect on
  the bindings).  :ticket:`10`

- Complete missing implementations in complex types with simple content.
  :ticket:`6`

- Create new code generation model which supports inter-namespace and
  inter-schema dependency cycles.  Namespace archives can now holds all
  namespaces that depend on each other.

- Other miscellaneous. :ticket:`11`

- Did I mention the ability to handle OpenGIS?  :ticket:`16`

Beware:

- Most of the classes in the new code generation model are undocumented.

- The interface to `pyxbgen` has changed completely.  Look at
  ``examples/OpenGIS/makebind.sh`` or other scripts in the ``examples``
  directory.


0.4.x (Stable)
==============

0.4.0 (20 Jun 2009, rev 1204)
-----------------------------

First usable public release.

- Use expanded names for all declarations and definitions. :ticket:`1`

- Use the finite automaton content model for generation as well as
  parsing. :ticket:`2`

- Support xsi:type and xsi:nil. :ticket:`3`

- Support substitution groups. :ticket:`4`

- Fix many problems in QName resolution

- Implement the remaining date/time types

- Rework content model so binding instances are always instances of the
  binding for the corresponding XML type, with no intervening element
  instance

- Add support for SAX parser

0.2.x (Stable)
==============

0.2.0 (30 May 2009, rev 818)
